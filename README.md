* **Find events around you**
  * **Search event by event name:** Users are able to use the search bar at the home page to find events base on event title, event description or event date.
  * **Indicate your interest:** Users can indicate interest in an event to mark their attendance before event becomes full. Initiators of events are not allowed to revoke their interests.
  * **Confirm your attendance:** After users confirm their attendance, they are not able to revoke their attendance 2 days before event starts.
  * **Join the telegram group:** Users can join the telegram group that is provided by the initiator by clicking on the "Join Telegram" button beside the attendance confirmation button to stay in touch with the organisers and other participants.

* **Create a new event**
  * **Create an event you love:** Users can create an event if they do not find an event that they want to join.
  * **Choose the date:** Users have to choose a date and time for the event. Event will not show up on the event list in the home page after event has passed.
  * **Choose the location:** Initiators have the choice to choose a location from a set of locations in NUS. This will make their events visible on the maps section. Choosing others as location will only make the event visible in the event list and not on the maps.
  * **Set the maximum number of people:** Users can set the maximum number of people in the case where the event requires a fixed number of people. An example of such a case could happen when the initiator is looking for a total of 4 players to play card games.
